# E-commerce Microservices Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture of an e-commerce platform built using a microservices approach. The platform is designed to be scalable, modular, and maintainable, leveraging **Node.js with TypeScript**, **MongoDB** (separate database per service), **RabbitMQ** for event-driven communication, **REST APIs** for inter-service and client communication, and **Elasticsearch** for search functionality. The system consists of **10 microservices** and an **API Gateway**, each handling a specific domain of the e-commerce platform.

### Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js with TypeScript, Express.js for REST APIs.
- **Databases**: MongoDB (separate database per service), Elasticsearch for Search Service.
- **Messaging**: RabbitMQ for event-driven communication.
- **API Gateway**: Node.js with Express or a dedicated gateway (e.g., Kong).
- **Deployment**: Docker for containerization, Kubernetes for orchestration.
- **Security**: JWT for authentication, HTTPS for APIs, MongoDB role-based access.

### Architecture Principles

- **Database per Service**: Each microservice has its own MongoDB database to ensure loose coupling and independent scalability.
- **Event-Driven Communication**: RabbitMQ enables asynchronous events (e.g., order creation triggers inventory updates).
- **REST APIs**: Services expose REST endpoints for synchronous communication.
- **Single Entry Point**: The API Gateway routes client requests to appropriate services and handles authentication.

## Microservices Overview

The platform comprises 10 microservices and 1 API Gateway, each with a specific responsibility. Below is a detailed description of each component.

### 1. API Gateway

- **Purpose**: Acts as the single entry point for all client requests, routing them to appropriate microservices and handling cross-cutting concerns like authentication and rate limiting.
- **Functionalities**:
  - Route client requests to microservices.
  - Authenticate requests using JWT tokens (verified via User Service).
  - Rate limiting to prevent abuse.
  - Logging and monitoring of requests.
- **Database**: None (stateless).
- **APIs**:
  - Proxy endpoints for all services (e.g., `/api/users/*`, `/api/products/*`, `/api/search/*`).
  - Example: `GET /api/products` routes to Product Catalog Service.
- **Events**: None (does not publish or consume events).
- **Interactions**:
  - Receives client requests (web, mobile, etc.).
  - Forwards requests to services via REST (e.g., `http://product-service/api/products`).
  - Validates JWT tokens by calling User Service (`/api/users/validate-token`).
- **Tech Details**:
  - Framework: Node.js + Express + TypeScript or Kong.
  - Libraries: `express-gateway` or `http-proxy-middleware` for routing.

## System Workflow Example (Order Placement)

1. **Client**: Sends `POST /api/orders` to API Gateway with JWT.
2. **API Gateway**: Validates JWT via User Service, routes request to Order Service.
3. **Order Service**:
   - Retrieves cart from Cart Service (`GET /api/cart`).
   - Reserves stock via Inventory Service (`POST /api/inventory/reserve`).
   - Processes payment via Payment Service (`POST /api/payments`).
   - Creates order in `order_db`, publishes `order.created` to RabbitMQ.
4. **Inventory Service**: Consumes `order.created`, updates stock in `inventory_db`.
5. **Shipping Service**: Consumes `order.created`, generates shipping options in `shipping_db`, publishes `shipping.updated`.
6. **Notification Service**: Consumes `order.created`, `payment.success`, `shipping.updated`, sends email/SMS.
7. **Search Service**: Consumes `product.updated` or `review.created` (if related), updates Elasticsearch index.
8. **Client**: Searches products via `GET /api/search?q=laptop`, routed to Search Service, which queries Elasticsearch.

## Infrastructure Setup

- **Docker**: Each microservice runs in a separate Docker container.

  - Example `Dockerfile` for a service:

    ```dockerfile
    FROM node:18
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY package*.json ./
    RUN npm install
    COPY . .
    CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]
    ```

- **MongoDB**: 9 separate databases (`user_db`, `product_db`, etc.) using Docker or MongoDB Atlas.

  - Example Docker Compose for `product_db`:

    ```yaml
    services:
      product_db:
        image: mongo:latest
        ports:
          - "27018:27017"
        volumes:
          - product_data:/data/db
    volumes:
      product_data:
    ```

- **Elasticsearch**: Single instance for Search Service (`docker run -p 9200:9200 elasticsearch:8.8.0`).
- **RabbitMQ**: Single instance with durable queues (`docker run -p 5672:5672 rabbitmq:3-management`).
- **Kubernetes**: Orchestrate containers, scale services, and manage MongoDB/Elasticsearch clusters.
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus for metrics, Grafana for visualization, Winston for logging.

## Security Considerations

- **Authentication**: JWT tokens issued by User Service, validated by API Gateway.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access (e.g., admin-only endpoints in Product Catalog Service).
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive MongoDB fields (e.g., user passwords, payment details) using `bcrypt` or MongoDB encryption.
- **API Security**: HTTPS for all REST APIs, API keys for service-to-service communication.
- **Database Security**: Separate MongoDB credentials per service, role-based access control.
- **Elasticsearch Security**: Enable authentication (e.g., API keys) for production.

## Scalability and Performance

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Scale high-traffic services (e.g., Product Catalog, Search) using Kubernetes.
- **Database Optimization**:
  - MongoDB: Use indexes (e.g., `productId` in `inventory_db`, `title` in `product_db`) and sharding for large datasets.
  - Elasticsearch: Optimize mappings and analyzers for search performance.
- **Caching**: Use Redis for caching search results or frequently accessed data (e.g., product details).
- **Event Reliability**: RabbitMQ durable queues and retries ensure no event loss.

## Deployment Plan

- **Local Development**: Use Docker Compose to run all services, MongoDB databases, Elasticsearch, and RabbitMQ.

  - Example `docker-compose.yml` snippet:

    ```yaml
    services:
      api-gateway:
        build: ./api-gateway
        ports:
          - "3000:3000"
      user-service:
        build: ./user-service
        ports:
          - "3001:3001"
        depends_on:
          - user_db
      user_db:
        image: mongo:latest
        ports:
          - "27017:27017"
      # Add other services and databases
      elasticsearch:
        image: elasticsearch:8.8.0
        ports:
          - "9200:9200"
      rabbitmq:
        image: rabbitmq:3-management
        ports:
          - "5672:5672"
          - "15672:15672"
    ```

- **Production**: Deploy on AWS/GCP with Kubernetes, MongoDB Atlas for managed databases, and Elastic Cloud for Elasticsearch.
- **CI/CD**: Use GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.

## Future Enhancements

- **Recommendation Service**: Add personalized product suggestions using machine learning.
- **Analytics Service**: Track user behavior and sales metrics.
- **Advanced Search**: Implement autocomplete and fuzzy search in Elasticsearch.
- **Database Scaling**: Shard MongoDB databases for high-traffic services (e.g., `product_db`, `order_db`).

## Conclusion

This architecture provides a robust, scalable foundation for the e-commerce platform, with 10 microservices and an API Gateway covering all core functionalities (user management, product catalog, inventory, orders, payments, cart, shipping, reviews, search, notifications). The database-per-service approach ensures independence, while Elasticsearch powers advanced search, and RabbitMQ enables loose coupling. The system is designed for an MVP but is extensible for future growth.
